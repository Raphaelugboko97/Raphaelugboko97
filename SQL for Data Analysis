-- DATABASE: A collection of tables that share connected data stored in a computer.
-- ERD: A diagram that shows how data is structured in a database.
-- SQL: A language that allows us to access data stored in a database.
-- NoSQL stands for not only SQL.  It is popular for web-based data, but less popular for data that lives in spreadsheets. Most popular one is MongoDB.

SELECT id, occurred_at, channel from web_events
LIMIT 50

-- The ORDER BY statement allows us to sort our results using the data in any column.

-- Write a query to return the 10 earliest orders in the orders table. Include the id, occurred_at, and total_amt_usd.
SELECT id, occurred_at, total_amt_usd from orders
ORDER BY occurred_at 
LIMIT 10;

-- Write a query to return the top 5 orders in terms of largest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd.
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd 
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd desc
LIMIT 5;

-- Write a query to return the lowest 20 orders in terms of smallest total_amt_usd. Include the id, account_id, and total_amt_usd.
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd 
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd 
LIMIT 10;

-- Write a query that displays the order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for all the orders, sorted first by the account ID (in ascending order), and then by the total dollar amount (in descending order).
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd 
FROM orders
ORDER BY account_id asc, total_amt_usd desc
LIMIT 5;

-- Now write a query that again displays order ID, account ID, and total dollar amount for each order, but this time sorted first by total dollar amount (in descending order), and then by account ID (in ascending order).
SELECT id, account_id, total_amt_usd
FROM orders
ORDER BY total_amt_usd desc, account_id asc
LIMIT 10;
